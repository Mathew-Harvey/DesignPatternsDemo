# Design Patterns Web Application Project

## Project Overview
This project is an exploration into the implementation of classic design patterns within a web application context, using a C# backend, MongoDB for data storage, and a JavaScript, HTML, and CSS frontend. Each session focuses on a different design pattern, providing a practical example of its use.

### Goals
- To create a web application showcasing eight fundamental design patterns.
- To provide clear examples and explanations of each pattern.
- To develop an understanding of how these patterns can be used in real-world scenarios.

### Development Setup
Before starting with the individual design patterns, make sure to set up your development environment and project structure by following the instructions in [Initial Project Setup and Boilerplate](00-Initial-Project-Setup.md).

### Sessions
Each session below will guide you through the implementation of a specific design pattern.

1. **[Session 1: Project Setup](documentation/01-Setup-Framework-Structure.md)**
   - Establish a single instance of a database connection using the Singleton pattern.
2. **[Session 2: Singleton Pattern](documentation/02-Singleton-Pattern.md)**
   - Establish a single instance of a database connection using the Singleton pattern.
4. **[Session 3: Factory Method Pattern](documentation/03-Factory-Method-Pattern.md)**
   - Learn how to use the Factory Method to create objects.
5. **[Session 4: Abstract Factory Pattern](documentation/04-Abstract-Factory-Pattern.md)**
   - Implement a family of related objects with the Abstract Factory.
6. **[Session 5: Builder Pattern](documentation/05-Builder-Pattern.md)**
   - Construct complex objects step by step using the Builder pattern.
7. **[Session 6: Prototype Pattern](documentation/06-Prototype-Pattern.md)**
   - Create new objects by copying existing ones with the Prototype pattern.
8. **[Session 7: Adapter Pattern](documentation/07-Adapter-Pattern.md)**
   - Make incompatible interfaces work together with the Adapter pattern.
9. **[Session 8: Decorator Pattern](documentation/08-Decorator-Pattern.md)**
   - Add responsibilities to objects dynamically using the Decorator pattern.
10. **[Session 9: Facade Pattern](documentation/09-Facade-Pattern.md)**
   - Provide a simplified interface to a complex system with the Facade pattern.
11. **[Session 10: Project Review and Wrap-Up](documentation/10-Project-Review-and-Wrap-Up.md)**
   - Review and reflect on the patterns implemented in the project.

# Design Patterns Web Application

## Introduction

This project is an experimental web application aimed at teaching and demonstrating software design patterns through a practical, hands-on approach. By integrating AI-driven guidance, the goal is to provide an interactive learning experience that emphasizes understanding the application of design patterns in a real-world context. Each web page within the application showcases a unique design pattern, using a C# backend with MongoDB and a JavaScript/HTML/CSS frontend.

The project is structured to allow learners to engage with both the theoretical aspects of design patterns and their practical implementation. The application itself serves as an illustrative example, with each page representing a different pattern, tied together by a consistent user interface and user experience design.

## Project Setup

### Prompt 1: Setting Up the Web Application Framework and Structure
Ensure that the application has a clean MVC structure, with modular components and a navigation system that ties together the eight design pattern pages.

**User Story:**
- As a developer, I want to establish a robust web framework to facilitate the addition of pages that demonstrate various design patterns.
- As a user, I want an intuitive navigation system that allows me to easily explore different design pattern implementations.

### Singleton Pattern

### Prompt 2: Implementing the Singleton Pattern Page
Create a Singleton pattern page that manages a MongoDB connection pool, reflecting a single instance's use in the UI.

**User Story:**
- As a user, I want to interact with a service that clearly uses a single instance to handle my requests, reinforcing the Singleton pattern's concept.

### Observer Pattern

### Prompt 3: Developing the Observer Pattern Page
Develop a page demonstrating the Observer pattern through a live subscription and event update system.

**User Story:**
- As a user, I want to subscribe to events and receive live updates, experiencing the dynamic nature of the Observer pattern.

### Factory Method Pattern

### Prompt 4: Creating the Factory Method Pattern Page
Illustrate the Factory Method pattern with a user interface that allows for the creation and display of different object types based on user selection.

**User Story:**
- As a user, I want to choose an object type to create and see the results, understanding the Factory Method's utility.

### Strategy Pattern

### Prompt 5: Building the Strategy Pattern Page
Build a Strategy pattern page where users can select and execute different algorithms, with the capability to compare outcomes.

**User Story:**
- As a user, I want to apply different algorithms to a dataset and view the outcomes, learning about the Strategy pattern's flexibility.

### Adapter Pattern

### Prompt 6: Assembling the Adapter Pattern Page
Set up a page that uses the Adapter pattern to interface with an external API, showcasing the adaptation process and result.

**User Story:**
- As a user, I want to interact with an external service via the application and understand how the Adapter pattern facilitates this communication.

### Decorator Pattern

### Prompt 7: Crafting the Decorator Pattern Page
Design a Decorator pattern page that allows for dynamic feature additions to an object, with a visual representation of each added feature.

**User Story:**
- As a user, I want to enhance a base object with additional features and observe the changes, visualizing the Decorator pattern in action.

### Command Pattern

### Prompt 8: Implementing the Command Pattern Page
Implement a Command pattern page with a user interface for performing and reversing actions, accompanied by a command log.

**User Story:**
- As a user, I want to issue commands to a system and have the option to undo/redo them, appreciating the Command pattern's control mechanism.

### Composite Pattern

### Prompt 9: Integrating the Composite Pattern Page
Create a Composite pattern page that allows users to construct and manipulate a hierarchical structure like a file system.

**User Story:**
- As a user, I want to build a nested structure and see its hierarchy, exploring the Composite pattern's approach to tree structures.
