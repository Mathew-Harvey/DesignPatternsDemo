# Session 6: Facade Pattern

## Goal
Showcase the Facade pattern to provide a simplified interface to a complex system, making it easier for client applications to interact with the system.

## Pseudocode
```csharp
// Complex subsystem classes
public class PaymentSystem {
    public bool ProcessPayment(string paymentDetails) {
        // Process the payment
        return true;
    }
}

public class InventorySystem {
    public bool CheckInventory(string productId) {
        // Check inventory for the product
        return true;
    }
}

public class ShippingSystem {
    public bool ScheduleShipping(string address) {
        // Schedule the product for shipping
        return true;
    }
}

// Facade class
public class OrderFacade {
    private PaymentSystem _paymentSystem = new PaymentSystem();
    private InventorySystem _inventorySystem = new InventorySystem();
    private ShippingSystem _shippingSystem = new ShippingSystem();

    public bool PlaceOrder(string productId, string paymentDetails, string address) {
        if (!_inventorySystem.CheckInventory(productId)) {
            return false;
        }
        if (!_paymentSystem.ProcessPayment(paymentDetails)) {
            return false;
        }
        return _shippingSystem.ScheduleShipping(address);
    }
}

// Client code
public ActionResult PlaceOrder(string productId) {
    OrderFacade orderFacade = new OrderFacade();
    bool result = orderFacade.PlaceOrder(productId, "paymentDetails", "address");
    
    // Return a view with the order result
}
```

## Tasks
Identify the complex parts of the system that need simplification.
Implement the subsystems that perform the underlying operations.
Create the Facade class that provides a simple interface to the complex subsystems.
Set up a controller action that uses the Facade to process requests.
## User Story
As a user, when I visit the Facade pattern page, I should be able to place an order with a single click, without needing to interact with the payment, inventory, and shipping systems separately.

## Hosting Solution
Keep developing on localhost and plan for future deployment on cloud services like Heroku or Azure, along with MongoDB Atlas for the database.

## Expected Outcome
An operational Facade pattern example where the complexity of the subsystems is hidden behind a simple interface.

## Time Allocation
Subsystem setup: 1 hour.
Facade class implementation: 1 hour.
Controller action and business logic: 1 hour.
Frontend UI for simple order placement: 1 hour.
